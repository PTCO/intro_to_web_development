ntroduction
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) plays a crucial role in web development by defining how HTML elements are styled and displayed on web pages. Understanding the syntax and structure of CSS is essential for controlling the appearance of content and ensuring consistent design across websites.

CSS Syntax and Structure
CSS is composed of rules that define the presentation of HTML elements. Each rule has three parts:

Selector: Identifies the HTML element to be styled (e.g., h1 for headings).

Property: Specifies the aspect of the element to modify, such as color or margin.

Value: Sets the desired property value (e.g., color: red; changes text color to red).

Types of Selectors
Selectors allow targeted application of styles:

Element selector: Targets all occurrences of a specific HTML tag (e.g., p { color: blue; }).

Class selector: Styles elements with a particular class, prefixed by a period (e.g., .intro).

ID selector: Targets a single, unique element using a hash symbol (e.g., #header).

Applying CSS to HTML Documents
There are three main methods to apply CSS:

Inline CSS: Styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. This method is suited for small, specific changes.

Internal CSS: Defines styles for a single page by embedding them in the <style> tag within the <head> of the HTML document.

External CSS: Links a separate stylesheet file to multiple HTML documents using the <link> tag, which is especially useful for larger projects due to its reusability.

Conclusion
By mastering CSS syntax and selectors, developers gain control over the styling of HTML elements, allowing for consistent and efficient design. Understanding how to apply CSS using inline, internal, and external methods enables the creation of flexible, scalable, and well-organized web pages.

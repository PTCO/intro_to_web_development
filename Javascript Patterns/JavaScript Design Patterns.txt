Introduction
JavaScript design patterns offer structured solutions to recurring coding problems, improving code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

Key Patterns
Module Pattern
Encapsulates private variables and functions to avoid global namespace pollution.

Creates self-contained, reusable blocks of code, keeping the codebase organized.

Example: Use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to restrict access to private variables and expose only necessary functions.

Observer Pattern
Manages object communication by notifying subscribed "observers" of state changes, ideal for event-driven systems.

Helps coordinate updates across multiple parts of an application.

Example: A "subject" class maintains a list of observers, notifying each change when an event occurs.

Singleton Pattern
Ensures only one instance of a class, providing a single point of access across the system.

Useful for resources that need centralized control, such as a single manager or controller.

Example: Use an instance check within the class to prevent the creation of multiple instances, maintaining a single reference.

Conclusion
Applying these JavaScript design patterns allows developers to write clean, organized code that is easy to manage and scale, making them essential tools for efficient software development.

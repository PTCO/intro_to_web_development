By using C# with Blazor, developers can create efficient, maintainable applications without relying on JavaScript.

Introduction to Blazor
Blazor is a web framework by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It enables full-stack development by using C# for both front-end and back-end, offering two main hosting models:

Blazor WebAssembly: Runs client-side in the browser through WebAssembly, enabling C# code to execute directly in the browser without JavaScript.

Blazor Server: Renders components server-side and updates the client via real-time connections, providing a lightweight front-end experience.

Blazor leverages the .NET ecosystem, allowing code sharing between client and server, reducing duplication, and providing a unified development environment. It is ideal for developers familiar with C# who want to build modern, interactive web UIs without switching to JavaScript.

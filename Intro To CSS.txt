Introduction
This guide covers essential techniques for creating flexible, responsive web layouts using CSS tools like Media Queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

Steps to Create Responsive Web Layouts
1.   Start with a Mobile-First Approach

Design for small screens first (e.g., smartphones), then progressively enhance for larger screens like tablets and desktops.

2.   Use Media Queries for Screen Adaptation

Apply different styles based on screen characteristics (width, height) using media queries. For example, set breakpoints for mobile (max-width: 480px), tablet (481px to 768px), and desktop screens (769px and above).

@media (max-width: 600px) {

Example syntax:

  			 /* Styles for small screens */

             }

3.   CSS Flexbox for Simple, One-Dimensional Layouts

Use Flexbox to organize elements in a row or column. It adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, allowing for responsive layouts without changing the HTML structure.

Activate Flexbox with:

display: flex;

4.  CSS Grid for Complex, Two-Dimensional Layouts

Use CSS Grid to design structured layouts with precise control over rows and columns. Ideal for more complex layouts across multiple dimensions.

Example: display: grid;

grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;

5.  Responsive Units for Dynamic Sizing

Use percentage (%), viewport width (vw), and viewport height (vh) units to ensure elements scale proportionately on any screen size.

Example:width: 50vw; /* Element takes up 50% of the viewport width */

Conclusion
By combining a mobile-first design, media queries, and responsive CSS tools (Flexbox, Grid, and Units), you can create layouts that adapt seamlessly to any device.

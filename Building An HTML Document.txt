Introduction
This step-by-step guide is designed to help you create a fully structured HTML document that incorporates user-friendly forms, organized tables and lists, and embedded media elements such as images and videos. By following these instructions, you can build a functional and visually organized webpage that ensures accessibility for all users.

Step-by-Step Guide
Start with the HTML Structure

At the top of your document, declare HTML5 with <!DOCTYPE html>.

Add the opening <html> tag, and inside it, create two main sections: <head> and <body>.

Set Up the Head Section

In the <head>, use the <title> tag to define the page's title (this is what appears in the browser tab).

Include a <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag to ensure that text is displayed correctly across languages and browsers.

Link to your CSS stylesheet with <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> to control the design of your webpage.

Build the Body Section

Use the <body> tag to enclose all visible content on the page.

Start with a main heading using <h1> and a paragraph using <p> to provide an introduction to the webpage's purpose or content.

Create a Form for User Input

Use the <form> tag to collect user data. For example:

<form action="submit.php" method="POST">

    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name">

    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email">

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>

Define the action attribute to specify where the form data will be submitted and use the POST method to ensure secure data transmission.

     5.    Add a Table to Display Data

Use the <table> tag along with <tr> for table rows, <th> for headers, and <td> for data cells. Here's an example:

<table>

    <tr>

        <th>Product</th>

        <th>Price</th>

        <th>Quantity</th>

    </tr>

    <tr>

        <td>Apples</td>

        <td>$2.00</td>

        <td>10</td>

    </tr>

</table>

     6.    Organize Items with Lists

For ordered steps, use <ol>, and for unordered items, use <ul>.

<ol>

    <li>Step 1</li>

    <li>Step 2</li>

</ol>

<ul>

    <li>Item 1</li>

    <li>Item 2</li>

</ul>

     7.    Embed Media Elements

Add images using the <img> tag, ensuring to specify the src (image path) and alt (alternative text for accessibility):

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

Use the <video> tag to embed videos, providing controls for the user:

<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>

Conclusion
This guide has outlined building a structured HTML document with essential elements such as forms, tables, lists, and media. By following these steps, you can create a well-organized and accessible webpage that enhances user experience and supports a range of interactive content. Always prioritize accessibility features like alt text for images and ensure compatibility across different browsers with appropriate media formats.
